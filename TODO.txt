# GFX

create puzzle piece images.

# IDEAS

Have "news flash" states that span over levels, some are bogus news. some offer improvements from the R&D team back on earth, like: improved missile speed, increased blast radius, superfluous construction rubble is cleared (puzzle area).

Have a flying saucer make appearances.


# TWEAKING

A few levels in moon rocks and empty barrels pile up. Need a mechanism to reduce these.
Perhaps filled rows can disappear.
Perhaps a bomb block type.

increase turret reload time.

lose more points on bases destroyed.

in arcade mode, destroy the incoming asteroids until the defense strike arrives (the countdown timer).

reseat panels on fullscreen toggle.


# BUGS

during puzzle phase if the board fills up and the game ends, it must reset the arcade mode bonus counters.
