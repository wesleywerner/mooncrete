# IDEAS

Have "news flash" states that span over levels, some are bogus news. some offer improvements from the R&D team back on earth, like: improved missile speed, increased blast radius, superfluous construction rubble is cleared (puzzle area).

Have a flying saucer make appearances.


# TWEAKING

A few levels in moon rocks and empty barrels pile up. Need a mechanism to reduce these. Perhaps filled rows can disappear.
